# About Project
This Project is about tracking the real-time health of all parts of the turbine including generator, blades. Apart from these the live parameter obtained from the sensors   such as wind direction, temperature, current, voltage, pressure, power, and altitude which would be further sent to a dashboard having some decision-making ability on predefine dataset. The Webpage has 3 sections the first one which includes data obtained from all sensors that is visualized in the form of donuts and bar charts. A chat-bot has been implemented as well for assistance purpose and booking an appointment. Average power for a period of last five newly inserted data is calculated as well for day range specific as well. Lastly a caution button has been implemented that would trigger an alert in case value of power and rpm surpasses the limit set. The second section consists of the service alert page in which the client can raise issues which would be stored in the firebase and finally the last section that is an about us page describing about the makers and what the project is all about.
